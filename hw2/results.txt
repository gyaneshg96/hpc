Machine Details :
model name      : Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7200U CPU @ 2.50GHz
memory          : 8 GB
cache size      : 256 KB
cores           : 4
address sizes   : 36 bits physical, 48 bits virtual


1.knm is the best order of all the possibilities as per the experiment because 
  The inner loop containing 'i' is a part of A and C.
  To access different i, we can easily read in the entire column, as it is column major (pth and jth for A and C respectively)
  and this is done only once in the inner loop.

2. Blocksize for which best performance is achieved :  32

3. Peak flop rate = Number of cores * Average frequency * number of instructions * No. of cpus
= 2 * 2.50 * 4 * 4 = 80 Gflops/S

Best flop rate achieved  ~ 10 Gflops/sec
So percentage = 12.5 %
